# RealistikPanel!
The modern admin panel for osu! private servers!

It uses libraries such as Flask for web and is designed to interface with the Ripple stack (mainly with SQL and Redis).

# About

You may notice that some of this code (especially the early one) is not too great. This is because this is a learning trip for me.
I am using a lot of libraries and concepts that are new to me and it's the first time I'm doing them.
This may be reflected in the quality of the code. I will try to fix up or replace some of the old code when I'm satisfied with the feature set.

This project is now ready to be deployed as a full replacement to RAP.

# Feature set
Everyday tons of new features
- Recent Plays
- Common statistics and graphs (dashboard)
- Logging in using osu! server accounts (thanks Kotypey)
- Bancho Settings (viewing and editing)

Almost everything RAP has to offer and more!
